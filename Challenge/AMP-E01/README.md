## AMPscript IF Statements

### What is this
This is an AMPscript Exercise that I have developed to help new users to Marketing Cloud to better understand how AMPscript IF Statements work.
Through this Exercise you will learn a few common/basic methods of building IF Statements in a simulated marketing email.
Sample data is provided to ensure you can follow the tasks and reproduce the required outcomes.<br/>
