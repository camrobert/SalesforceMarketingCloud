## AMPscript Loops & Lookups

### What is this
This is an AMPscript Exercise that I have developed to help new users to Marketing Cloud to better understand how to use AMPscript FOR LOOPS with LookupRows.
After completing this pair of exercises you will have an understanding of how to use AMPscript For Loops and Lookup functions together to create content on Cloud Pages and Emails.
