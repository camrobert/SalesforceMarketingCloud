## AMPscript Loops

### What is this
This is an AMPscript Exercise that I have developed to help new users to Marketing Cloud to better understand how AMPscript FOR LOOPS work.
Through this Exercise you will learn a few common/basic methods of building FOR LOOPS in an email or Cloud Page.</br>

### How this exercise works

Firstly, make sure you understand how FOR LOOPs and IF Statements work; You can see my videos on these topics here: [Introduction to IF Statements in AMPscript](https://youtu.be/zpYzHklr_3M) & [AMPscript FOR LOOP - Salesforce Marketing Cloud Functions in 5 minutes](https://youtu.be/dvohaNrpevk) <br/>
2. Once you've learnt the basics of FOR LOOPs and IF Statements in AMPscript, you can download the challenge brief here: [AMP-E02 AMPscript Loops](AMP-E02%20AMPscript%20Loops.pdf) <br/>
3. Follow the instructions provided in the AMP-E02 brief, solving each task in order.<br/>
